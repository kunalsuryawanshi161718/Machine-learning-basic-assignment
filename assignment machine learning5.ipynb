    "•\tThe quality and quantity of data is very important in term of collecting the data that you are going to feed in your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tvisualize the data and balance the features if there is any correlation between features, we can filter it and we can reduce the dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tChoosing the correct model for the project. We can use algorithms of classification, prediction, linear regression, clustering, i.e. k-means or K-Nearest Neighbour, Deep Learning, i.e Neural Networks, Bayesian, etc.\n",

    "•\tCheck out the accuracy of the modal\n",

    "## 2. Describe quantitative and qualitative data in depth. Make a distinction between the two.\n",
    "Ans: - Quantitative and qualitative data provide different outcomes, and are often used together to get a full picture of a population. For example, if data are collected on annual income (quantitative), occupation data (qualitative) could also be gathered to get more detail on the average annual income for each type of occupation. Quantitative data are measures of values or counts and are expressed as numbers.\n",
    "Quantitative data are data about numeric variables (e.g. how many; how much; or how often).\n",
    "Qualitative data are measures of 'types' and may be represented by a name, symbol, or a number code.\n",
    "Qualitative data are data about categorical variables.\n",

These algorithms can be used when the dataset contains null or missing values.\n",
