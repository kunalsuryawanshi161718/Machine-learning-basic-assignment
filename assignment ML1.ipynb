    "## 1. What does one mean by the term \"machine learning\"?\n",
    "Ans:- It is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicit programmed It is the branch of Computer science and Artificial Inteligence.\n",
    "## 2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?\n",
    "Ans: - 1- Handling large Dataset \n",
    "\n",
    "2- Handling Complex traditional programming way to train data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 – Handling complex business predictive models\n",
    "\n",
    "4 – Management and analysis of complex Data can be handle softly by Machine Learning technique \n",
    "\n",
    "## 3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - A set of data which help in giving the solution of any task is refer to Labeled Training set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?\n",
    "Ans: - Regression and Classification\n",
    "## 5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - four common unsupervised task are: - \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualisations, Clustering , Associative learning, Dimensional reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk through various unfamiliar terrains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Using reinforcement learning The terrains or environment will generates rewards/feedback according to Feedback the robot will take an action. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different groups?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: -  Both supervised and Unsupervised learning can be used according to It’s labelling if it is labelled group it will follow supervised learning else will follow unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or unsupervised learning problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Spams are known and Labelled like what kind of spam is it, so it is supervised learning problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9.What is the concept of an online learning system?\n",
    "\n",
    "And: - In online learning the system learns incrementally and it is feed with individual data or mini batches. Each learning step is fast and when the new data arrived it keeps learning after being deployed\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - To handle a very large amount of data in GB which cannot be fit into the computer memory or RAM, is comes under out of core learning in which the data is divided into the chunks and then we train the models using incremental learning or online learning system.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity measure?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- Instance based learning algorithm makes predictions e.g(KNN,RBF networks, kernel functions)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12.What's the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in a learning algorithm?\n",
    "\n",
    "And: - A model parameter is the features already present in the data by using through we design our model But in hyperparameter the features is external to the model whose value cannot estimate from the data source.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? What is the most popular method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make predictions?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Model based learning algorithm search for the optimal value of parameters in a model that will give the best results for the new instances. We often use a cost function or similar to determine what the parameter value has to be in order to minimize the function. The model makes prediction by using the value of the new instance and the parameters in its function.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Overfitting, underfitting , scattered data, lack of data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize the results to new situations? Can you think of three different options?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Either may be the chances of overfitting or Underfitting makes it fails to generalize the results to new situation, we can reduce it by removing outliers or inserting more data or by implementing simple model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: -  A test set is the set of data which is applied to trained model. It helps in giving the accuracy of model weather the data is good or bed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17.What is a validation set's purpose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Validation set is a set used to compare between different training models\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you put it to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - The train-dev set is used when there is a risk of mismatch between the testing data and the data used in validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - If you tune hyperparameters using the test sets, then it may not perform well on the out-of-sample data because the model is tuned just for that specific set.\n"
