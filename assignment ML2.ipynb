    "## 1. What is the concept of human learning? Please give two examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Every human has different process of learning ,  it varies from person to person. The terms Knowledge, Skill, and Memory being used to define intelligence. Just because you have good memory, that does not mean you are intelligent. And just because you are intelligent, it does not mean you should have a good memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What different forms of human learning are there? Are there any machine learning equivalents?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Human being learn by memorizing the thing or by practical implementation or by past experiences. In machine learning the past dataset is used to structure the algorithm which is slightly equivalent to human being learning via past experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What is machine learning, and how does it work? What are the key responsibilities of machine learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - In term of learning, the machine learning is the technique of analyse the data that teaches computers to learn information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Define the terms \"penalty\" and \"reward\" in the context of reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Penalty: - It is the negative response given by environment to the agent.\n",
    "Reward: - It is the positive response generated by environment  and according to that response the agent perform an action to environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Explain the term \"learning as a search\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - It is the task of learning through a large space hypotheses and fins the hypothesis that best fit in the training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What are the various goals of machine learning? What is the relationship between these and human learning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  - Things like growing volumes and varieties of available data, computational processing that is cheaper and more powerful, and affordable data storage. All of these things mean it's possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyse bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results – even on a very large scale. And by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. Illustrate the various elements of machine learning using a real-life illustration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Modal, data, task, loss function, Evaluation, learning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Provide an example of the abstraction method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - It is the practice of reducing complexity by arranging code and the data in to a conceptual manner. For example, A software developer may develop an object called document that is abstract such that it can’t be fetched or used directly but instead defining common characteristics of entity such as HTML Document. \n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. What is the concept of generalization? What function does it play in the machine learning process?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: -generalization is a definition to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data. Training a generalized machine learning model means, in general, it works for all subset of unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10-What is classification, exactly? What are the main distinctions between classification and regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - classification is the type of supervised learning in which the response values produces at the output is discrete suppose I have a dataset model that predict the identification as cat or dog then the response at output will be discreate in nature it can be either 0 or 1 , while in regression output responses values are continuous example : weight, height, time etc.  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What is regression, and how does it work? Give an example of a real-world problem that was solved using regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - It is the type of supervised learning which gives continuous value of responses at the output. The nature of predicted data is ordered. for example a simple linear regression model using advertising spending as the predictor variable and revenue as the response variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Describe the clustering mechanism in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - A cluster is the type of unsupervised learning where the labelled has not given so we make groups of similar item’s together and each groups belongs to different identity which is based on its own property or behaviour or feature. The features are directly proportional to similarity measure  \n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. Make brief observations on two of the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Machine learning algorithms are used\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning algorithm are categories in to three types supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Studying under supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervise learning the dataset is labelled. Supervised learning algorithm is also categorized in to two types classification and regression. In classification algorithm the model produces discrete values of output while in Regression the output labelled data is continues in nature. \n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Studying without supervision\n",
    "\n",
    "In unsupervised learning the dataset is unlabelled. Unsupervised learning algorithm is categorised in to two parts clustering and association. \n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Reinforcement learning is a form of learning based on positive reinforcement.\n",
    "A special type of Machine Learning where the model learns from each action taken. The model is rewarded for any correct decision made and penalized for any wrong decision, which allows it to learn the patterns and make better accurate decisions on unknown data.\n"
