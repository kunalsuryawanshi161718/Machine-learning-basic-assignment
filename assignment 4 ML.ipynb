    "## 1. What are the key tasks involved in getting ready to work with machine learning modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - \n",
    "    \n",
    "Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Collect the data: The quality and quantity of data is very important in term of collecting the data that you are going to feed in your machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 2: \n",
    "    \n",
    "Prepare the data: - visualize the data and balance the features if there is any correlation between features, we can filter it and we can reduce the dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose the modal: \n",
    "\n",
    "Choosing the correct model for the project. We can use algorithms of classification, prediction, linear regression, clustering, i.e. k-means or K-Nearest Neighbour, Deep Learning, i.e Neural Networks, Bayesian, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "Train your machine model:\n",
    "\n",
    "You will need to train the datasets to run smoothly and see an incremental improvement in the prediction rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 5: Evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Check out the accuracy of the modal\n",
    "\n",
    "Task 6:\n",
    "\n",
    "Parameter Tuning:\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the accuracy we can adjust overfitting and underfitting curve or we can set the learning rate parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Data used in machine learning are: - \n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical Data: - any data where data points are exact numbers.e.g. continuous(height,weight,salary,temp) and discreat(language,number of student)\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical Data: - data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Series Data: - \n",
    "\n",
    "data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. For example, we might measure the average number of home sales for many years.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Distinguish:\n",
    "\n",
    "           1. Numeric vs. categorical attributes: - Numerical attributes are represent in numbers such as measurements they are continues and discreet in nature for example weight, height, number of students in class etc. while in categorical the object belongs to certain class or it carry a particular characteristic for example player’s position, team, hometown.\n",
    "           \n",
    "            2. Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction: - Feature selection and dimensionality reduction both methods are used for reducing the number of features in a dataset, there is an important difference.\n",
    "            \n",
    "Feature selection is simply selecting and excluding given features without changing them.\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction transforms features into a lower dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Make quick notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "            1. The histogram: - The histogram is the analysis graph tool which is used when the data is numerical data type. It is used to show frequency distribution values. Example: Analysing whether a process can meet the customer’s requirements\n",
    "            \n",
    "             2. Use a scatter plot: - The scatter diagram graphs pairs of numerical data, with one variable on each axis, to look for a relationship between them. If the variables are correlated, the points will fall along a line or curve. It is used when you have paired numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. Why is it necessary to investigate data? Is there a discrepancy in how qualitative and quantitative data are explored?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Collecting and analysing data helps you see whether your intervention brought about the desired results. Qualitative data can sometimes tell you things that quantitative data can’t.  It may reveal why certain methods are working or not working, whether part of what you’re doing conflicts with participants’ culture, what participants see as important, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What are the various histogram shapes? What exactly are ‘bins'?\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tNormal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tSkewed Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDouble-Peaked or Bimodal\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tPlateau or Multimodal Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tEdge Peak Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tComb Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tTruncated or Heart-Cut Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "•\tDog Food Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Bins are also sometimes called \"intervals\", \"classes\", or \"buckets\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. How do we deal with data outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Trimming/removing the outlier: - In this technique, we remove the outliers from the dataset. Although it is not a good practice to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantile based flooring and capping: - In this technique, the outlier is capped at a certain value above the 90th percentile value or floored at a factor below the 10th percentile value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean/Median imputation: - As the mean value is highly influenced by the outliers, it is advised to replace the outliers with the median value.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. What are the various central inclination measures? Why does mean vary too much from median in certain data sets?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - numeric averages - Arithmetic mean, geometric mean, harmonic mean\n",
    "\n",
    "           positional averages - median and mode\n",
    "\n",
    "           when there are outliers mean very too much from median in certain dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. Describe how a scatter plot can be used to investigate bivariate relationships. Is it possible to find outliers using a scatter plot?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - A scatter plot can be used to investigate correlation between two features by observing the data points weather they are lying on straight line or not. Similar in case of other functions also like trigonometric or quadratic. And we can also find the outliers using scattered plot also.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Describe how cross-tabs can be used to figure out how two variables are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - Cross tabs or cross tabulation are only used to find relations between two categorical variables where one categorical variable value would be giving row data and the other variable would give column data. Several tests like the chi square test can help find relations based on the cross tab.\n"
