    "## 1.Explain the term machine learning, and how does it work? Explain two machine learning applications in the business world. What are some of the ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - the term machine learning refer to the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being complexity of programming. Examples: - a simple Machine learning model using advertising spending as the predictor variable and revenue as the response variable. And in supply chain department the ML model help in giving predictions of expenditures. the ethical concerns that machine learning applications could raise are Misuse of information, autonomous technology, respect for employee and customer, moral use of data and resources etc. \n",

    "Active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience.

    "Ans: - Obliviously not, because to solve the problem its all depends on the quality of data and the data scientist. Overall, it is just a tool like the other algorithm tool which is used to make decision classification and prediction by using statistical and mathematic approaches. Machine Learning works best on repetitive applications with an easily defined goal, like the image classification problem. An algorithm can be applied to thousands of images, it never gets tired, and it can be copied and run by others around the world.\n",

    "## 8. Can you explain the various forms of supervised learning? Explain each one with an example application.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - there are two form of supervised learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression: The regression model is based on correlation of labelled data with respect to selected features and gives continuous value of labelled data. For example, regression can help predict the price of a house based on its locality, size, etc. there are two types of regression modal linear and logistic relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification: - Here in classification the data is categorized in to certain set of groups. learning algorithm labels input data into two distinct classes, it is called binary classification. Multiple classifications mean categorizing data into more than two classes. Example Navis bays classification, and to determine whether or not a person would be a loan defaulter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning? With a sample application in each region, explain the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: - The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labelled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labelled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "In supervised learning, the algorithm “learns” from the training dataset by iteratively making predictions on the data and adjusting for the correct answer. While supervised learning models tend to be more accurate than unsupervised learning models, they require upfront human intervention to label the data appropriately. For example, a supervised learning model can predict how long your commute will be based on the time of day, weather conditions and so on. But first, you’ll have to train it to know that rainy weather extends the driving time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning models, in contrast, work on their own to discover the inherent structure of unlabelled data. Note that they still require some human intervention for validating output variables. For example, an unsupervised learning model can identify that online shoppers often purchase groups of products at the same time. However, a data analyst would need to validate that it makes sense for a recommendation engine to group baby clothes with an order of diapers, applesauce and Sippy cups.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Describe the machine learning process in depth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: -Machine learning ultimately works by using algorithms. These algorithms are constantly searching for patterns, looking for data that can be understood and grouped together. It uses this data and the algorithms to help it learn from the past and then make guesses or predictions about the future. \n",
    "\n",
    "3 main types of machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of machine learning algorithms that control how machine learning specifically works. They are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. These three different options give similar outcomes in the end, but the journey to how they get to the outcome is different. \n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning, supervised learning is fairly hands-on. It involves a human giving the machine both the input and the output. The machine uses algorithms to find out how to get from point A to point B. By giving the machine the expected outcome, you help teach it how to find that outcome in the future. It uses algorithms to find the connections between point A and point B, and is able to learn from what it is observing about both the input variable and the output variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unsupervised learning.\n",
    "\n",
    " Unsupervised learning involves just giving the machine the input, and letting it come up with the output based on the patterns it can find. This kind of machine learning algorithm tends to have more errors, simply because you aren’t telling the program what the answer is. But unsupervised learning helps machines learn and improve based on what they observe. Algorithms in unsupervised learning are less complex, as the human intervention is less important. Machines are entrusted to do the data science work in unsupervised learning.\n",
    " \n",
    "reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement learning is an algorithm that helps the program understand what it is doing well. Often classified as semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning is when a machine is told what it is doing correctly so it continues to do the same kind of work. This semi-supervised learning helps neural networks and machine learning algorithms identify when they have gotten part of the puzzle correct, encouraging them to try that same pattern or sequence again. Sometimes reinforcement learning is given an output, sometimes it is not. The real goal of reinforcement learning is to help the machine or program understand the correct path so it can replicate it later\n",

    "##        iii. Study of the market basket\n",
    "\n",
    "Market basket analysis is a data mining technique used by retailers to increase sales by better understanding customer purchasing patterns. It involves analyzing large data sets, such as purchase history, to reveal product groupings, as well as products that are likely to be purchased together.\n",

    " \n",
    "Abstraction is the practice of reducing complexity by arranging code and the data in to a conceptual manner. For example, A software developer may develop an object called document that is abstract such that it can’t be fetched or used directly but instead defining common characteristics of entity such as HTML Document\n",

    "generalization is a definition to demonstrate how well is a trained model to classify or forecast unseen data. Training a generalized machine learning model means, in general, it works for all subset of unseen data.\n",

    "classification is the type of supervised learning in which the response values produces at the output is discrete suppose I have a dataset model that predict the identification as cat or dog then the response at output will be discreate in nature it can be either 0 or 1 , while in regression output responses values are continuous example : weight, height, time etc.  \n"
